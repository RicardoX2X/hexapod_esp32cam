# hexapod_esp32cam

A toy that i wanted to transform into a "real" robot with a ESP32-cam.
The control is made by a websever hosted inside the ESP, with camera stream.
Most of code until now was transcribed and adapted from [random nerd tutorials](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-cam-car-robot-web-server/)
